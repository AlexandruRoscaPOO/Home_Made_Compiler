# Project Title: Crafting Your Compiler with Bison and Yacc

## Creation Interval.
December 17, 2023-January 17, 2024

## Description
This homemade compiler leverages the combined capabilities of Bison and C++ to offer a versatile platform for storing variables, defining functions, constructing classes, executing complex calculations, and managing data dynamically. Powered by an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), this compiler ensures efficient parsing and error detection, enabling users to develop robust software solutions with ease. With its intuitive syntax and flexible architecture, it's the ideal tool for aspiring developers looking to explore the intricacies of compiler design and implementation.

## Features

- **Predefined Types**: Including int, float, char, string, and bool for efficient variable declaration and manipulation.
- **Array Types**: Supporting the declaration and use of arrays for structured data storage and retrieval.
- **User Defined Data Types**: Similar to classes in object-oriented languages, with custom syntax for initialization, variable access, and method invocation.
- **Control Statements**: Including if, for, while, and more, for program flow control and logic implementation.
- **Assignment Statements**: Featuring left-value assignment expressions for seamless variable assignment and modification.
- **Arithmetic and Boolean Expressions**: Supporting a wide range of arithmetic and boolean operations for versatile computation.
- **Function Calls**: Supporting parameters including expressions, other function calls, identifiers, and constants for flexible function invocation.
- **Predefined Functions**: Including Eval(arg) and TypeOf(arg) for evaluating expressions and determining variable types respectively.
- **Program Structure**: Organized into sections for user-defined data types, global variables, global function definitions, and an entry point function for program execution.
- **Error Checking**: Ensuring the integrity and correctness of programs by validating variable and function declarations, operand types, and function calls.
- **AST for Calculation**: Utilizing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for efficient and dynamic expression evaluation for int, float, char, bool, and double data types.
- **Data Stored in Tables**: Data is stored separately in tables for efficient retrieval and manipulation, enhancing the performance and scalability of the application.

And many more other features.
